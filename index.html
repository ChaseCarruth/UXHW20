        Grow Coffee App was designed to create a platform to maximize the
        capabilities of at home coffee makers. The 2020 pandemic made it more
        difficult for people to visit coffee shops, and most coffee at home just
        doesn't taste the same. We realized that we needed a professional
        platform for at home users to learn how to make better specialty drinks
        and coffee at home.
