        Grow Coffee App was designed to create a platform to maximize the
        capabilities of at home coffee makers. The 2020 pandemic made it more
        difficult for people to visit coffee shops, and most coffee at home just
        doesn't taste the same. We realized that we needed a professional
        platform for at home users to learn how to make better specialty drinks
        and coffee at home.

        Qualitative data was collected through five user interviews. This
        research lasted two days to cover data collection. An online survey
        derived from our research plan was conducted through Google
        Forms.Participants consisted of a wide range of coffee drinkers with
        varying work schedules. Through this research we discovered that users
        were highly interested in making better coffee at home would greatly
        value the ability to have their drinks be more similar to barista
        quality.

        Grow Coffee App was designed to provide a platform where users educate,
        inspire, and share knowledge for making the best quality coffee at home.
        Our research revealed that users care about the quality and taste of
        their coffee, but many users find it difficult to recreate barista
        quality coffee at home. As the at-home workforce grows, there's a need
        for users to learn how to utilize the equipment they have and learn new
        coffee making techniques, because misguided actions and lack of
        experience can lead to increased frustration, irritability, and wasting
        money.

          How might we create Grow Coffee App so that users can be successful in

        Finaly after much iteration and product testing we had a final
        prototype. We went with a sleek black design and a multi swipe layout to
        sell our idea of a professional level coffee tutorial app.
